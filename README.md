# YouTube-Project
The YouTube Project is a full-stack multimedia platform designed to allow users to upload, view, and manage videos across multiple devices. This project encompasses three core components: a web-based platform, a mobile application for Android, and a backend server built using Node.js and C++.

Web Platform (React): The web application is developed using React and provides users with an intuitive interface to search for videos, view content, and upload videos. It features a user-friendly layout similar to YouTube’s design, including navigation components such as a search bar, left sidebar, and a cloud bar for categories. The project leverages responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

Android App: The mobile application is built for Android, offering similar functionality to the web platform with additional features for mobile users. The app allows users to browse videos, upload new content, and filter by categories. It uses Room for local database management and Glide for efficient image handling. The app also includes user authentication, displaying either a login button or profile image in the bottom bar based on the user’s logged-in state.

Backend Server (Node.js and C++): The backend is designed using a combination of Node.js for handling API requests and C++ for performance-critical tasks. The server handles user authentication, video uploads, and media streaming. Node.js serves as the primary API layer, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server, while C++ is utilized for processing-intensive tasks such as video encoding and serving media files.

Database: The project integrates with both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL databases for user data and video metadata storage, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies, mobile development, and robust backend solutions to create a seamless multimedia experience.
